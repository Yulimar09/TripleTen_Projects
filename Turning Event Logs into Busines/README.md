### Turning Event Logs into Business Metrics

This project aims to analyze raw transaction logs to derive actionable business insights. Below is a step-by-step guide detailing the tasks involved in this project.

#### Table of Contents

- Executive Summary: It provides a condensed overview of key results and analyses derived from the data.  

- purchase_activity: It contains detailed information about user purchases, including various attributes associated with each transaction. 

- first_purchase: It contains information about users and the respective dates of their first purchases. 

- conversion_funnel: This section details the user journey through three stages: view, shopping cart, and purchase. 

- cohort_analysis: It presents a tabulated view of user cohorts based on their first purchase month and the subsequent cohort age.

- retention_rates: It provides a comprehensive view of user retention over time.

- raw_user_activity: Raw data collected encompassing seven columns: 
      - user_id	
      - event_type 
      - category_code 
      - brand 
      - price	
      - event_date"

#### Analysis

- Raw Data: The analysis process began with the collection of raw data in the "raw user activity" sheet, comprising seven columns, including user_id, event_type, category_code, brand, price, and event date.

- Conversion Funnel: The first step involved creating a pivot table, utilizing event_type and the count of unique user IDs, offering an initial overview of user interactions.  

- Retention Rates: Subsequently, a new sheet, "purchase_activity," was generated by filtering the raw data to isolate purchase transactions. The purchase_activity sheet was then employed for cohort analysis, where a pivot table was crafted to identify first_purchase_date and subsequently derive first_purchase_month from these dates.

#### Results 

Conversion Funnel: The provided conversion funnel data outlines a user journey through three key stages: view, shopping cart, and purchase. The analysis indicates that all users who viewed a product proceeded to the shopping cart, achieving a 100% conversion rate at this stage. However, there is a considerable drop-off in the overall conversion rate from the shopping cart to purchase, reaching 10%.

Retention Rates: The retention rates data highlights a consistent decline in user engagement over time, underscoring the challenge of sustaining interest beyond the initial month. Despite a strong start in the first month, cohorts, especially those initiated in later months, experienced a significant drop in retention rates by the fourth month.
