### Part 1: Profits & Losses: Identify Profit and Loss Centers.

To identify the important centers of profit and loss for the superstore, the analysis will delve into different pairs of dimensions. The two biggest profit centers and two biggest loss-makers will be determined, and conclusions will be justified with visualizations.

#### Visualization 1: Profit and Loss Centers

Conclusion: In analyzing the superstore's financial performance, Copiers and Binders emerged as the biggest profit centers in the West region, yielding $35,293.14 and $22,792.26, respectively. However, Tables in the East region incurred a substantial loss of -$12,073.13, and Binders in the Central region showed a loss of -$20,584.94. These findings highlight key areas for potential improvement and strategic decision-making.

#### Visualization 2: Products to Stop Selling

Conclusion: GBC DocuBind P400 Electric Binding System, Cubify CubeX 3D Printer Double Head Print, and Bush Advantage Collection Racetrack Conference Table should be considered for discontinuation due to their consistently negative profitability.

#### Visualization 3: Focus on Product Subcategories

Conclusion: The Superstore should focus on Copiers, Phones, and Accessories, as they are the most profitable subcategories. Tables, Bookcases, and Supplies, on the other hand, should be carefully reconsidered.

### Part 2: Advertising: Identify Advertising Opportunities

The 3 best combinations of states and months to advertise in will be identified, and the average profit for each month in those states will be visualized.

#### Visualization 4: Best States and Months to Advertise

Conclusion: Indiana, particularly in October, stands out as the most profitable state with the highest average profit per unit ($187.59) and overall profit ($643.15). Vermont in November and Rhode Island in December follow closely. Notably, Indiana also leads in advertising efficiency, spending an average of $128.63, suggesting a strong correlation between advertising spending and profit.

### Part 3: Returned Items: Analyzing Return Rates

Using the Returns table, products and customers with abnormal return rates will be identified, and visualizations will be created to answer specific questions.

#### Visualization 5: Products with Highest Return Rates

Conclusion: Products with the highest return rates include the KI Adjustable-Height Table, Global Leather Task Chair, Advantus Push Pins, Global Troy Executive Leather Low-Back Tilter, and Staple envelope. These products may need further investigation or reconsideration.

#### Visualization 6: Customers with Highest Return Rates

Conclusion: Customers with the highest return rates should be monitored, and the store may consider implementing measures to reduce returns from these customers.

#### Visualization 7: Profit vs. Return Rate Analysis

Conclusion: Same-day shipping, while yielding the highest average profit, also records the highest return rate, suggesting potential challenges. In contrast, Second Class demonstrates high profitability and the lowest return rate, indicating efficiency in both profit and customer satisfaction. Standard Class and First Class could benefit from further analysis to identify reasons for returns and potential areas for improvement. This concise overview provides insights for targeted strategies to optimize shipping modes.
