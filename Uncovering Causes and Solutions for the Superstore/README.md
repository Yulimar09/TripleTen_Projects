### Analyzing Return Rates and Building a Dashboard in Tableau

#### Returns Rate Causes

In this section, worksheets will be built to analyze different views on return rates.

#### Steps

#### Data Preparation:

LEFT JOIN the Returns table onto the Orders table.

Convert the Returned field into a calculated field where null values are 0 and "Yes" values are 1.

#### Worksheets to Build:

1. Scatterplot of Sales vs. Returns: Analyze the correlation between total sales and total returns, aggregated by product subcategory.

2. Bar Chart of Return Rate by Product Category: Visualize return rates across different product categories.

3. Return Rate by Customer: Identify customers more prone to making returns, and filter out customers with only 1 order.

4. Map Showing Return Rate by Geographic Measure: Analyze return rates by state.

5. Return Rate by Time Measure: Explore seasonal effects on return rates by analyzing them over time.

6. Composite Charts: Create composite charts showing return rates based on Ship Mode, Region, Month, and Category


#### Building a Dashboard for Monitoring Returns

In this section, a dashboard will be created based on the analysis.

Steps:

1. Low-Fidelity Mock-up: Create pen and paper sketches of dashboard variations.

2. Dashboard Creation: Create a template for the dashboard using empty containers to match the chosen mock-up. Add worksheets to the dashboard template.

3. Finalize the Dashboard: Add relevant markers, images, and titles as needed.


#### Presenting the Analysis and Dashboard

In this section, a story arc will be constructed for the presentation.

Steps:

1 Draft Story Arc:

- Summarize the analysis of returns.

- Discuss the measurement of returns and key root causes.

- Provide an overview of each component of the dashboard and how to interpret them.

- Demonstrate how to use the dashboard to identify root causes and propose next steps.



By following these steps, valuable insights into return rates will be gained, and an effective dashboard for monitoring and analyzing returns in the superstore project will be created.
